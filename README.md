# üñ•Ô∏è Self Host w/ Docker

## To start
go into any folder and run a `docker-compose up -d` to start a service

### Assumptions
many of the compose files assume that a hardrive has been mounted to /hdd.

This mount can be edited to fit your particular set up.

## To fully use a service
Most require logging in with a browser and completing a initial set up.

If there is any confusion usually the docker image's page will have additional details.

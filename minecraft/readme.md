# access
minecraft servers are not available through CF tunnels (only HTTP is supported by tunnels). I instead take the risk on forwarding a port and only allowing through an allow list.

There exist alternatives like modflared or plait.gg or spectrum. But port forwarding is the simple way.

# MCRON
on fedora, I needed to install from an rpm file
